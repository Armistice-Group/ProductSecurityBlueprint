# **The Product Security Blueprint: Resources and Labs**

This repository contains the official code samples, templates, and lab exercises for **The Product Security Blueprint**, published by [Publisher].

The goal of this repository is to provide a "paved road" for engineers transitioning into product security. Rather than theoretical examples, these resources are designed for use in real-world private sector cloud environments.

## **Repository Structure**

The repository is organized by chapter. Each directory contains the necessary Infrastructure as Code (IaC), scripts, and documentation to complete the exercises at the end of each chapter.

-   `/chapter-01`: Risk canvases and stakeholder communication templates.
    
-   `/chapter-02`: Secure VPC baseline (Terraform) and networking labs.
    
-   `/chapter-03`: CI/CD security pipeline snippets and secrets management configs.
    
-   `/templates`: Reusable, production-ready modules for various cloud services.
    

## **Prerequisites**

To get the most out of these labs, you will need:

-   An AWS Account (Free Tier is sufficient for most exercises).
    
-   **Terraform** installed locally.
    
-   **Python 3.x** for custom tool development.
    
-   A GitHub account for CI/CD labs.
    

## **How to Use These Resources**

Each chapter in the book ends with a **Practical Exercise**. Detailed instructions for these exercises are found in the `README.md` file within each specific chapter directory.

> **NOTE** These scripts are intended for educational and lab environments. Always review security configurations and adapt them to your specific organization's compliance requirements before deploying to production.
